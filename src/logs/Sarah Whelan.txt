Week 1 9/24 - 9/30

Looked into and wrote some test code that calls out to a matlab script.
Set up Java Spark server.
Added Mustache Template Engine and a CSS framework, Skeleton.
Added the "/" route to render a template with just a title.
Made sure everything was working ie templates worked and css loaded properly.

Week 2 10/1 - 10/7

Created a form that allowed images to be uploaded to the server.
The server takes the image and places it on disk.
Once the file has uploaded the file name is added to a list on the screen.
The list is draggable/orderable. This will handle the mapping of images to floors.

A screenshot of the current state of the UI after uploading two images and
while dragging a name is in /logs/screenshots/Sarah-Week2.png.

Week 3 10/8 - 10/14

Each time the filenames in the list were dragged the inputs to the form are 
updated to match. When the form is submitted the server gets a list of filenames
in order of floors. Once the server has this list it redirects to a page
that displays all of the images in a column. 

This page asks for two points - the starting and ending points for the path.
Added javascript to translate the two points locations on the image displayed
to points on the full sized image. Once the second point is clicked the data
is sent to the server again. Next week the server will send the two data points
and the order of the floors to the path finding algorithm.

A screenshot of this new screen is in /logs/screenshots/Sarah-Week3.png.
Both images/floors are displayed on that page but the screenshot only shows the
top image/floor.

Week 4 10/15 - 10/21

Created a class that handles creating a string command to run in the terminal/
command line that calls a matlab script with arguments. This passes in the 
data about the points that was collected last week. Also edited the matlab
a little to get the list of file names of all the images in floor order
that have been uploaded. This was difficult because everything wanted to
change and sanitize the string differently and different characters were
allowed in one language that did not work for the other. I spent a lot of time
trying to pass in the list of file names via the command line but I simply
could not figure out how to format the string to let me do that. I unfortunately
gave up on that and wrote out the image filenames/paths to a file that matlab
reads in. I think this week I was also supposed to parse the result from matlab.
We ended up deciding for now that since we were already drawing the path on top
of the images in matlab we would just have matlab save new images with the path
on them (for now we'll see if that is all we want in the future re week 6). All I
ended up having to do was display the newly saved files instead of the uploaded
versions. We also decided that matlab would output the path to a file and output
the places where the images/floors connect also to a file.

Week 5 10/22 - 10/28

Abstracted reading from a file in matlab and loaded the class path on method call.
Filled in the container class with the information javascript would need to update
the page and display the path and the steps. Added gson to handle taking this class
and serializing it to give it to the javascript. Refactored matlab service to use
the container instead of many method parameters. This way anything that needs to
process data before the results are returned can use the same container. Moved some
files around for convenience (js and css to their own folders if they are 3rd party
libraries). Got some scaffolding code that handles moving the points around when
the window resizes. Also added code that generates some "pretty" steps in that there
is a list of strings that should tell someone where to go. This will be improved later
but for now it just generates a list of steps and then displays that on the screen.
It now also swaps out the original image for the one that has the path drawn on it.
Matlab is actually drawing the path on the image and that may be good enough for now.
I think next week I was supposed to display the path on the image but since that is
already happening enough I may move forward to getting the interface to accept points
for exclusion instead and then revisit displaying the path in a more visually appealing
fashion. Though I think the exclusion points are more important and I think Jonathan
is scheduled for that next week as well so we might be better off if we do that at 
around the same time.

Screenshots in folder for week 5.

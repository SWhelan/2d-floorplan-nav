Week 1 9/24 - 9/30

Looked into and wrote some test code that calls out to a matlab script.
Set up Java Spark server.
Added Mustache Template Engine and a CSS framework, Skeleton.
Added the "/" route to render a template with just a title.
Made sure everything was working ie templates worked and css loaded properly.

Week 2 10/1 - 10/7

Created a form that allowed images to be uploaded to the server.
The server takes the image and places it on disk.
Once the file has uploaded the file name is added to a list on the screen.
The list is draggable/orderable. This will handle the mapping of images to floors.

A screenshot of the current state of the UI after uploading two images and
while dragging a name is in /logs/screenshots/Sarah-Week2.png.

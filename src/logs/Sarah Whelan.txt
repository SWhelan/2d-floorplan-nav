Week 1 9/24 - 9/30

Looked into and wrote some test code that calls out to a matlab script.
Set up Java Spark server.
Added Mustache Template Engine and a CSS framework, Skeleton.
Added the "/" route to render a template with just a title.
Made sure everything was working ie templates worked and css loaded properly.

Week 2 10/1 - 10/7

Created a form that allowed images to be uploaded to the server.
The server takes the image and places it on disk.
Once the file has uploaded the file name is added to a list on the screen.
The list is draggable/orderable. This will handle the mapping of images to floors.

A screenshot of the current state of the UI after uploading two images and
while dragging a name is in /logs/screenshots/Sarah-Week2.png.

Week 3 10/8 - 10/14

Each time the filenames in the list were dragged the inputs to the form are 
updated to match. When the form is submitted the server gets a list of filenames
in order of floors. Once the server has this list it redirects to a page
that displays all of the images in a column. 

This page asks for two points - the starting and ending points for the path.
Added javascript to translate the two points locations on the image displayed
to points on the full sized image. Once the second point is clicked the data
is sent to the server again. Next week the server will send the two data points
and the order of the floors to the path finding algorithm.

A screenshot of this new screen is in /logs/screenshots/Sarah-Week3.png.
Both images/floors are displayed on that page but the screenshot only shows the
top image/floor.

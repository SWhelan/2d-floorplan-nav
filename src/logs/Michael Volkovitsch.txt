Week 1: 9/24-9/30

	Worked with Jonathan
	Familiarized myself with MATLAB image handling, writing some misc code to load and edit the image
		files we plan to use.
	Wrote and uploaded a basic script to show the "dot grid" applied to the image files.
		The dots are spaced at an even width on the picture, and if there is no color between two dots
			they are connected with a line
		The resulting grid is then displayed on the image file
	Problems encountered
		Because the grid is 1 pixel thick, sometimes it won't initially display if the image needs
			to be scaled to fit on the screen (it shows up if you zoom in), which at first looked like a bug
		One point of the graph didn't connect properly using a wide width and only cardinal connections
			Potential fixes are:
				A denser grid
				Introduce diagonal edges
			
Week 2: 10/1-10/7

	Worked with Jonathan
	Edited last week's code to construct an adjacency matrix while searching for connections
	Started pathfinding code
		Also located in DotGrid
		Implementation of A* using the adjacency matrix
		Currently only pseudo code
			Needs to use Java priority queue, which needs a comparator function
				comparartor function needs to be written/compiled in Java and imported
			May be better to export the adjacency matrix to java code, than to import java structures
	Looking at calling java code from matlab
		rather than import java structures to implement A* in matlab, pass adjacency matrix to java implementation of A*
		need to figure out how data is passed to java code and how useful it will be
		according to documentation, the cell array used for the adjacency matrix will be passed as Object[]
			not sure if the 4D structure will be preserved
	Next week I'll determine what parts should be java and which should be matlab and finish the A* code in the appropriate laguage

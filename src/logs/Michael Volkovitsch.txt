Week 1: 9/24-9/30

	Worked with Jonathan
	Familiarized myself with MATLAB image handling, writing some misc code to load and edit the image
		files we plan to use.
	Wrote and uploaded a basic script to show the "dot grid" applied to the image files.
		The dots are spaced at an even width on the picture, and if there is no color between two dots
			they are connected with a line
		The resulting grid is then displayed on the image file
	Problems encountered
		Because the grid is 1 pixel thick, sometimes it won't initially display if the image needs
			to be scaled to fit on the screen (it shows up if you zoom in), which at first looked like a bug
		One point of the graph didn't connect properly using a wide width and only cardinal connections
			Potential fixes are:
				A denser grid
				Introduce diagonal edges
			
Week 2: 10/1-10/7

	Worked with Jonathan
	Edited last week's code to construct an adjacency matrix while searching for connections
	Started pathfinding code
		Also located in DotGrid
		Implementation of A* using the adjacency matrix
		Currently only pseudo code
			Needs to use Java priority queue, which needs a comparator function
				comparartor function needs to be written/compiled in Java and imported
			May be better to export the adjacency matrix to java code, than to import java structures
	Looking at calling java code from matlab
		rather than import java structures to implement A* in matlab, pass adjacency matrix to java implementation of A*
		need to figure out how data is passed to java code and how useful it will be
		according to documentation, the cell array used for the adjacency matrix will be passed as Object[]
			not sure if the 4D structure will be preserved
	Next week I'll determine what parts should be java and which should be matlab and finish the A* code in the appropriate laguage
	
Week 3: 10/8-10/14

	Decided that it made the most sense to do image processing in matlab and all pathfinding in java
	Matlab uses java 1.7 (supposedly being updated to 1.8 eventually), so I had to figure out how to compile java 7 code from a java 8 ide
	Implemented A* search in java using custom classes to represent the map locations and adjacencies
	Edited matlab code to use these new classes and methods
	Added primitive A* function in matlab which takes two user-selected points and displays a found path between them
		standard test is the matlab command "DotGrid('NoDoors.png', 36);"
	Bugs:
		the disaplyed path was going through walls, but I think I've fixed it although more testing should be done
			it was going from 0 indexed java locations to 1 indexed matlab locations that messed up where to draw the path
		the path doesn't appear to be entirely optimal
			one test run resulted in a path that made a "bump" in the path as poorly drawn below
			    _________
			___| 	     |_____
	To-do:
		Edit matlab file/function names
		Redo java class path for matlab
			currently uses full path on my machine, should be changed to a relative path if possible
			matlab may need the full path, which I would have to generated from the path of the matlab files
			
Week 4: 10/15-10/21

	Added diagonal connections to adjacency possibilities
		edited A* function to take this into account
		edited matlab code to look for this and to display this
	Made displayed path thicker
	Added variables to control showing results
	Now save path to image and text files
	Realized java files weren't getting commited because of the gitignore, so changed gitignore to allow .class files for matlab relevant java classes
	Wrote basic version of matlab function to be called from the website (FindPath)
	To-do:
		Finish redoing matlab structure
			Make FindPath the file function and create different file for backend test methods (currently DotGrid)
			Split most matlab functions into own files?
		Save path information to folder Sarah wants
		Add java files to repo
			currently just the .class file from my computer are getting built to the repo
					wasn't a problem since setting up to compile in java 7, but now other people may want to start editing them so I need to move the project

Week 1: 9/24-9/30

Familiarized myself with MATLAB image handling, writing some misc code to load and edit the image
	files we plan to use.
Wrote and uploaded a basic script to show the "dot grid" applied to the image files.
	The dots are spaced at an even width on the picture, and if there is no color between two dots
		they are connected with a line
	The resulting grid is then displayed on the image file
Problems encountered
	Because the grid is 1 pixel thick, sometimes it won't initially display if the image needs
		to be scaled to fit on the screen (it shows up if you zoom in), which at first looked like a bug
	One point of the graph didn't connect properly using a wide width and only cardinal connections
		Potential fixes are:
			A denser grid
			Introduce diagonal edges
